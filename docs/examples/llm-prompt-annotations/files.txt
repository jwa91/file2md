# LLM Prompt Annotations Example

## Instructions for the AI
I'm providing the code for a React application that needs to be refactored. Please analyze the provided files and help me:
1. Identify potential performance issues
2. Suggest improvements to the component structure
3. Identify any security concerns in the API implementation

## Project Documentation
README.md
package.json

## API Implementation
The API file below has some security issues I'd like you to identify:
src/api.js

## Component Structure
These components need to be reviewed for performance and reusability:
src/components/Button.js
src/components/Card.js
src/components/Input.js

## Configuration
The configuration below is used throughout the application and might need to be restructured:
src/config.js

## Please focus on these specific questions:
1. How can we prevent XSS attacks in our API?
2. What component patterns should we use to improve reusability?
3. Is there a better way to manage our configuration?
4. Are there any memory leaks in the components?
